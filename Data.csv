"Romain,Operations excellence Lead (France),Logiciel accessible,il y a 3 mois,  + 2 ans,Je recommande vivement l'utilisation d'Odoo dans les sociétés qui souhaitent digitaliser et améliorer leurs process. La clé d'une intégration réussie c'est de trouver un moyen de faire fonctionner le plus possible ses process dans les fonctionnalités standard d'Odoo. De cette façon on s'évite les développements et des prises de risque sur la stabilité de la solution.,""Odoo propose des fonctionnalités très larges pour couvrir une large spectre de métiers de l'entreprise et permettre leur digitalisation: son implémentation nous a permis de doubler de taille tout en conservant une équipe Supply Chain de taille constante. Cela en améliorant tous nos indicateurs de performance et avec un budget très limité. Depuis 2022 la nouvelle tarification permet d'ajouter autant d'applications que souhaité ce qui évite de trop réfléchir lorsque l'on souhaite tester une nouvelle application. L'outil est facile à utiliser au quotidien, et avec un peu de patience il est globalement facile à administrer. Contrairement à de nombreux autres outils, il est très facile de faire évoluer la solution sans accompagnement extérieur. J'ai dû faire 3 tickets de support en bientôt 3 ans d'utilisation."",""Le logiciel est économique si on reste sur une utilisation très standard. Dès lors que l'on souhaite créer des développements il faut trouver un partenaire Odoo de qualité. Cela peut être compliqué, et potentiellement coûteux. Odoo nécessite du temps pour bien maîtriser l'administration, mais il existe beaucoup de ressources pour apprendre."",France,positive,1.0,5";;;

We use the Manufacturing Module and the CRM Module prominently and these have both been brilliant tools that we are very happy with internally. The MRP is excellent at automating our manufacturing process whereby our production manager has only to add orders to the system while the system itself creates the PO's, calculates times and helps us to schedule our work. The CRM for the sales side is really easy to use and browse through and has a very good tagging feature allowing me (as sales director) to easily filter accounts and keep track of leads."",""The initial implementation was painful to say the least.. We stated using Odoo way back in 2015 so this may have been due to our slow uptake of the software how ever I recall that once we signed up as paid users, there was very little support given to set up the system (unless we paid extra for the hourly support..). This was a big issue as we never had an easy way to contact someone for help with little configurations and therefore had to do most of the implementation ourselves.

"I went from spending several hundred dollars per month to fight w/ my previous inventory management system to spending a few hundred dollars once for a small servlet and have really unleashed the engagement and creativity of my inventory management and procurement departments."",""The Community version is completely free, no strings attached. You have to set it up, secure it, and host it yourself. The docker container available makes it a perfectly smooth and configurable deployment. If you or your IT department has any ability to use Docker to deploy applications on an internal network, they should be able to have Odoo Community up and running in an afternoon at most (if they can't, fire them). Odoo is complicated as it can cover a vast scope of your operations. Therefore, setup is complicated. We spent about 1 week from 1 person to get it ready to roll out. At the end of that week we had imported all our materials for purchasing (~500 items) and products we sell (~250 SKUs) from our previous inventory management system (MRPEasy) INCLUDING BOMS. Because of the incredibly effective bulk import features, simple guides, and logical workflows, we switched over to Odoo about 2 weeks earlier than our planned rollover date. I have yet to encounter anything I would consider a defect or a bug in the software. We have customized several forms to eliminate buttons or features not used, add columns and fields, and track some extra reference IDs for other systems on our products. Very easy platform to do deep configuration/manipulation on. The PDF generation and customization engine is very easy to use and works great. It was also easy to edit the code of the PDF template to make some stylistic changes to the forms we generate. If you know basic HTML and CSS, Odoo is simple enough to understand and navigate that you can really get deep in customization. The intra-app communication via """"Activities"""" is ubiquitous in the platform and makes for very effective todo lists being integrated into the app that the """"work"""" happens in."",It really wants to send emails and manage communications.

The pros of this ERP system outweigh the very negative start to using this system, and I cannot stress enough to not deal with the Support Pack system as the level of talent of Odoo Project Managers is low. They will overcharge you and not really give you much more than anything you could have expected from a recent graduate out of a college."",""We loved this for the ERP system of integrating our lead management, supply chain management, quotation system, accounting system, CRM system, and inventory all into one area. We previously had to force together multiple different sites and systems (i.e. Jobber, Quickbooks, Monday/DaPulse) and after many years of growth we simply have outgrown these dated systems and can no longer afford the time to micromanage so many transactions. We also needed automation on multiple areas of our service, which Odoo has been able to provide. After extensive training, NOT FROM ODOO LET ME TELL YOU, we have been able to customize this fairly well to our complicated value add manufacturing processes."",""I have had the worst time with customer service when it comes to Support Pack Hours. Not only were we billed for every millisecond of time, but we were easily overcharged for time as well. One simple email response would take 6-10 minutes of our support park. After asking for a service level document multiple times, they simply have not provided one. They also hid the fact that support pack hours expire. We began our Odoo integration just before COVID hit, and we had to stop the Odoo integration for a few months, only to be met with many hours being used on ODOO EMAILING US for updates on when we would come back. In the time spent with them implementing our systems to Odoo, they easily have dropped the ball so much with such low support that we had to hire a third party consultant to get this system up and running the way THEY MARKETED TO US and how we initially envisioned this working."",É.-U.,negative,-1.0,5";;;

It is packed with features like Accounting, Project Management, Customer Management, Employee & Recruitment Management, Inventory & Warehouse, Sales and Purchase and POS to name a few. I like the Dashboard where one can get an bird's eye view of the status of any task or activity that needs attention. Plenty of additional modules (called Apps) are also available on the Odoo Store. Odoo uses Postgresql as database. It offers plenty of customisation options. Some countries' standard Chart of Accounts are available by default, or you can create your own. Overall a very useful ERP."",""I'm reviewing the Community Edition: On the downside, it has a relatively big learning curve. Setup and initial configuration is crucial. I would have liked to choose between mySQL and Postgresql as some hosting providers does not offer Postgresql. Some minor frustrations is the fact that an invoice can only be created after a quotation, then an order. I would've liked to be able to enter an invoice without an quote or order";" for example monthly regular contractual invoices. Having said that, depending on how your business work, it might not affect you that much. Secondly, recording expenses is cumbersome - expenses are recorded either through the employer expense module (which is not always related to an employer, like rent), or through billing. Either way, you need to create a """"product or service"""" for expenses before entering them. Where and how you enter them, also affects your expense reporting. I would also like to see more reporting options like traditional desktop apps.

This has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of my employees, allowing them to spend less time juggling different tools and more time focusing on their core tasks.In addition, Odoo's project management functionality allowed me to better track the progress of my projects, set clear deadlines and ensure that tasks were properly allocated to team members. This allowed for better collaboration between team members and more efficient management of resources. I was also able to track sales and purchases more efficiently, using Odoo's stock management and invoicing features.Finally, one of the main benefits I have realised from using Odoo is better visibility of my business as a whole.

POS systems have limited hardware options Adding inventory is multi-screen / excessive click function. Shipping apps don't work well. All non-tech staff HATE the platform. System generates excess volumes of emails that can't be turned off. Paid hosting doesn't support NON WWW domain names. I never saw that problem in 20 years of hosting websites!

For example, the need to reallocate inventory from one mfg order in order to deal with reprioritizing demand is important. Right now - orders have to be cancelled to release inventory. It would be nice to simply """"unreserved"""" as we do with a delivery note. Similarly, the purchasing module treats ALL orders as a request for quote for any orders that have not been confirmed by a vendor. A purchase order that has not yet been confirmed is NOT a request for quote. That is a totally different function and continues to cause problems with vendors and requires a much higher level of maintenance to make sure that purchase orders are actually being received. Another area that would be helpful is that if an order is being generated for replenishment due to min/max settings and NOT actual demand - that those orders are identifiable as replenishment and also do not override (or allocate) inventory over demand driven requirements. Even though a replenishment rule does technically constitute a demand signal - it should not take priority over real demand - particularly where we are trying to manage inventory to lean standards. Certainly, in an ideal world - the level of inventory should handle replenishment as well as real demand - but when demand spikes for a real customer - we need to be able to not build to replenish - but instead go ahead and release for our customer and pick up replenishment on the back end when additional inventory from suppliers are available.

The availability of a large community and marketplace for additional modules and integrations was also a major advantage."",""While I found many positive aspects of Odoo, one thing I liked least was the complexity of the initial setup and configuration.
